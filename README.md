   * Outputs a list of new threats that need to be blocked.
   * Write the Output to a SQLite Database
   * Write a python script that extracts the data from the SQL lite Database and exports the data to json format
* Uses environment variables with a configuration file for API credentials
* Provide the JSON file and Python Code as evidence
